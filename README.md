Overview
===============

In part 8 we add tests to the project.  Ideally we would have followed the BDD convention, but alas, we are adding tests after the fact.  In this chapter we will add the mocha module and
write a single test.  Additionally we will hook up scripts section of package.json to run the tests via npm test.
